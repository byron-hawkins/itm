### Integrated Tutorial Model


This repository represents an archive snapshot of a research project from 2003
focusing on the cost and complication of developing and maintaining user
interface tutorials, integrated documentation and notifications of errors and
usage problems. Original prototypes were developed in the context of
entrepreneurial ventures in social media, so although they offer a pragmatic
application of the ITM concepts, it may be difficult to run the prototypes on
current platforms. The author is in the process of uploading the original
sources and hopes to have them available by February 24, 2019.
